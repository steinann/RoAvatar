    TODO: (How to finish the unfinished code)
    ISSUE: (A bug/issue/inaccuracy with THIS program, these should be fixed as they are inaccurate)
    BUG: (A bug/issue with roblox, these should NOT be fixed as to maintain accuracy)

ISSUES (Relating to renderer inaccuracy):
    -SKELETON: Tongues are usually rotated incorrectly
        -Interestingly the skeleton looks to be posed and animated correctly
    -LC: Layered clothing ignores outer cage during deformation, its imporant somehow but not sure what it does (i think anything outside shouldnt be deformed? but that might give weird results and doesnt seem right), also the deformation should sample BOTH the inner and outer cage! (rip performance)
    -LC: Layered clothing does not use HSR (Hidden Surface Removal) and does not deform the body/inner clothing to avoid clipping
    -LC: AutoSkin ignores vertex groups, https://create.roblox.com/docs/art/accessories/automatic-skinning-transfer for more info
    -LC: Layered clothing uses RBF-deformation for cage layering instead of linear deformation
    -LC: Layering breaks when 2 meshes with identical caging are worn
    -LC: WrapDeformer does not affect layers
    -ANIMATION: Inaccurate motor6d when a bundle has a weird rest pose, see bundle 197642307876020 as an example
        -This is because we ignore the RigAnimationData in the animation that is used when Workspace.Retargeting is Enabled!
    -ANIMATION: Blending is not correct, at all. It shouldnt lerp with the rest pose like its doing now...
    -MATERIALDESC: When a composed texture has transparency the color of the transparent parts may look incorrect
        -This may be caused by this issue with ThreeJS: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/32802

ISSUES (General):
    -RenderableDesc's fully regenerate instead of only regenerating the part that requires regeneration

FEATURES:
    HIGH PRIORITY:
        -Remember unsaved outfit
        -Thumbnail customization
        -Load other peoples avatar/outfits
		-Lines and such when adjusting accessory
        -Loading indicator for avatar preview
        -Better alert and warnings system
        -Button that shows assets in bundle
        -Reset to currently wearing
    MEDIUM PRIORITY:
        -Publish outfits to Roblox (like in the mobile app)
        -Save outfit as .rbxm
        -Gear inside preview
		-Autosave setting
		-Layered clothing quality setting
        -Write custom number in scale sliders
        -Snapping for adjustment sliders
    LOW PRIORITY:
        -Particle rendering
