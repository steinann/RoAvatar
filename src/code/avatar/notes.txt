-- Accessory and LC limits
    -- 5 reserved for accessories
    -- 5 reserved for LC
    -- 5 shared between accessories and LC
    IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT USE ASSETTYPE TO DETERMINE IF ASSET IS LAYERED, regular accessories can have wrap layers! this is also probably why 5 slots are shared
        Depending on scenario you either want to check for wrap layer or check assettype AND if it can be a layered accessory (example: hair)

--Limits i think for real this time (WRONG)
    - Total count (should not be added twice for hair) <= 15
    - Accessory count <= 10
    - Can be layered count (includes hair and stuff) <= 10

--Limits
    - Accessory count <= 10
    - Layered count <= 10
    EyebrowAccessory, EyelashAccessory and HairAccessory count in both (really?? i think its only hair)
