# RoAvatar Privacy Policy
**Last updated: 23/02/2026**

RoAvatar is designed to operate locally on your device and to respect your privacy. This policy explains what data the extension collects, how that data is used, and whether it is shared with any third parties.

## Information We Collect
RoAvatar stores a small amount of data on your device using the browser’s storage system. This may include:
- Extension settings
- Local outfit configurations
- Other preference data required for the extension to function

RoAvatar does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information, browsing data, or usage analytics.

## How We Use This Data
All data stored by RoAvatar is used solely to provide core functionality, such as remembering your settings and outfits between sessions.
All data remains on your device and is not sent to any external servers.

## Data Sharing
RoAvatar does not share any data with third parties.
No data is transmitted to the developer or any external service.

## Data Security
Because all data is stored locally and never transmitted, the risk of exposure is minimized. Your data stays on your device unless you manually clear your browser storage.

## Changes to This Policy
If RoAvatar’s data handling practices change in the future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
